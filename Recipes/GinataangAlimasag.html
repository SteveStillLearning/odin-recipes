    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There is something singularly delectable about crab meat. Perhaps it is its natural linamnam, both sweet and a tad fishy. In the Philippines, especially in the Bicol region, one of the best preparations of this tasty crustacean is Ginataang Alimasag or crab in coconut milk. Before we teach you how to cook Ginataang Alimasag, let’s make sure you get the right kind of crab. In Philippine waters, there is an abundance of alimango (giant mud crabs, which often reside near mangroves, or where seawater and freshwater mingle) and alimasag (flower crab or blue swimmer crab, found in the ocean). To avoid getting lost in the terminologies, just remember that the alimasag is smaller than the alimango, is usually speckled, and is bluish in color when uncooked. Alimasag do not have the alimango’s signature bulbous claw. Let this not fool you, though; alimasag meat, while tricky to pick off its smaller shelled body, brims with flavor. Sometimes, it even borders on buttery! This Ginataang Alimasag recipe is so beginner-friendly, you can whip it up in less than 30 minutes. Your quick gata fix, thanks to Knorr Ginataang Gulay Complete Recipe Mix. If you’re hungry for more veg, you can always make it a Ginataang Alimasag at Kalabasa dish. Time to get cooking!</p>
